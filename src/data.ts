  title: "The Heart Behind HAMPERS_4_YOU",
  subtitle: "A Philosophy of Slow Gifting and Handcrafted Magic",
  paragraphs: [
    "HAMPERS_4_YOU was born out of a simple, yet powerful observation: in an increasingly digital, hyper-fast world, the deeply human act of gifting was becoming transactional. Beautiful boxes were packed on assembly lines, and greeting cards were printed in thousands with hollow sentiments. Our founder believed that a gift is more than physical content—it is a physical container of emotions, respect, and celebration.",
    "Driven by a lifelong love for classic paper calligraphies, textiles, and fine organic design, our founder set up an artisanal studio dedicated to reviving the art of customized slow-gifting. Each bespoke item—whether it is a carefully coordinated hamper box, a customized velvet ring platter, or a calligraphed sacred certificate—is designed by hand from the ground up, in close consultation with the client.",
    "Our creative workspace behaves like an haute-couture bridal house. We do not mass-produce, nor do we stock finished packages. We take time to discuss your vision, review the colors of your bridal attire, matching ribbons to the groom's sherwani, and curating elements that evoke deep nostalgic joy. It is this intense attention to detail and unyielding devotion to quality that transforms our creations into unforgettable wedding centerpieces."
  ],
  quote: "Gifting is not a mere social exchange; it is the physical expression of a relationship's beauty. We make sure that your gratitude and celebration is felt in every ribbon thread, calligraphed curve, and wax seal crest."

  {
    question: "Do you have ready-made hampers or products I can buy immediately?",
    answer: "No, we do not operate as an off-the-shelf catalog shop. Because we believe in true luxury, every single gift hamper, ring platter, or certificate is custom-tailored to order. This guarantees that your gift is completely unique and matches your exact celebration event theme."
  },
  {
    question: "How far in advance should I book my order?",
    answer: "Given the handcrafted nature of our designs (specifically handbinding velvet platters, custom mirroring acrylic, and written calligraphic sheets), we strongly recommend placing orders 2 to 3 weeks before your ceremony. For urgent orders, please contact us directly on WhatsApp as we occasionally have rush design slots."
  },
  {
    question: "How does shipping work, and is it secure for fragile items?",
    answer: "We ship all custom orders utilizing premium courier options with bubble wrapping and heavy double-walled boxing. Elegant glass domes, mirror platters, and frames are packaged carefully inside shock-resistant liners to ensure they arrive at your doorstep in pristine condition."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize the wording on the Nikah certificates?",
    answer: "Absolutely. You can provide your custom religious vows, specific translation preferences, names, and witness labels. We format your exact words into classical elegant calligraphy templates before finalizing."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the role of the Personal Gifting Planner?",
    answer: "Our Personal Gifting Planner is a curated digital workspace that acts as your private consultation advisor. It allows you to select customized boutique services, specify event themes/color palettes, choose exquisite packaging materials, and add bespoke calligraphed details. This generates a cohesive digital concept sheet that acts as our literal layout brief. When you reach out to our studio, our Master Planner reviews this concept sheet with you in a dedicated 1-on-1 session to perfect every real-world fabric ribbon, wax seal, and floral detail."
